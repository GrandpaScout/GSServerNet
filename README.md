# `❰GSServerNet❱` Figura-to-Server Communication
This library allows Figura avatars to "talk" to the Minecraft server they are on.

This is done through `/trigger` commands from the client and `/tellraw` commands from the server.

## Installation
To install either side of ServerNet, download this repository and open the `.zip` file it gives you.

To install the client, open the `client` folder and copy the `GSServerNet.lua` file into your avatar.  
Follow the instructions in the [client README](./client/) to set it up with your avatar.

To install the server, open the `server` folder and copy the `GSServerNet` folder into your `<world_file>/datapacks`
folder.  
Enable it like any other datapack and follow the instructions in the [server README](./server/) to set it up with your
server.

Instructions for installing ServerNet modules is given in the [`modules`](./modules/) directory.
